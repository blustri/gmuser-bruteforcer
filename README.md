# mailuser-bruteforcer
a python script to generate all possible emails from given obfuscated mail string

# use cases
you know how when you reset an account password (e.g. instagram accounts) it'll show you the obfuscated email?
something like "a******d@mail.com"

this script is to bruteforce all possible combinations (basically goes thru every letters for each * in the string)

works for every mail providers (duh its just a script to generate stuff)

any questions just ask me on discord @raddicale

# important! 
before you go use it, do check the code and tweak it since i was too lazy to actually make it take arguments and change stuff

theres an allowed_chars mode, if u toggle it off, it'll only generate combinations using the letters in allowed_chars[] list
